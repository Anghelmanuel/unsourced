<h2>About</h2>

<h3>What is all this?</h3>

<p>So many newspaper articles are published with missing or vague references
to their original sources.

</p>
<p>
Unsourced is a tool to help us all augment news articles with the stuff that
they <em>should</em> be including but don't.
</p>


<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>

<p>
Without sources, it is very hard to gauge the accuracy of an article.
<ul>
<li>Does the journalist know the subject they are writing about?</li>
<li>Have the correct conclusions been drawn?</li>
<li>Did they even read the primary source, or are they relying on a press release?</li>
<li>Are they trying to hide that the research is unsound?</li>
</ul>
Without the source, there's no way to tell.
</p>

<p>
Or, as Ben Golacre put it:
"<a href="http://bengoldacre.posterous.com/if-you-dont-link-to-primary-sources-you-are-d">If you don't link to primary sources, you are dead to me</a>"
</p>

<h3>Status</h3>

<p>
We decided to focus on science articles to begin with. There are lots of
examples of sloppy - or just plain wrong - science reporting, so it's an
area that needs scrutiny.
</p>
<p>
It's also a nicely formal area, in that most science stories relate to the
publication of peer-reviewed paper in a Journal, which can be tracked down.
</p>
<p>
The plan is to expand the set of tools to cover all sorts of things that
might be sources for news stories - government reports, raw data, press
releases, etc etc...
</p>

<h3>Why are there so many articles from the UK?</h3>

<p>We use the article search at
<a href="http://journalisted.com">journalisted.com</a> to find articles
which look like they might need sourcing. Since journalisted has a
particular focus on the UK media, so does this site.
</p>
<p>
However, you can manually enter any article you'd like, using the form on
the <a href="/">front page</a>.
