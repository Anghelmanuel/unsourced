Sourcy TODOs
------------

In rough order of priority:

[DONE] Fix bad wording on points

Warning labels

[DONE] collapse identical stories

fix up google academic search box

League tables on front page
 - table of users who've performed the most popular actions

Should we have an option along the lines of 'no source required' or 'Opinion - no source absent'?
 - idea: could be implemented with tagging (or lack of a "source-missing" tag)
 - How should the UI work?

Link to churnalism
 - tool to pick up most likely press releases and easily add them (with any metadata).


Fix thankyou page (or get rid of it all together)
 - try out a popup box...


Add more logon options
 - support generic openid providers?
 - idea: share accounts with journalisted
 - facebook.

front page: show small tag icons beside articles

allow users to delete tags they added

Batch operations: apply a source to a set of articles
 - how should the UI work?

Allow manual pasting of article text on paywalled sites (or just when the scraper gets it really wrong)
